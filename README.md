#Submission Manager
**Code Louisville PHP Project**

This CRUD app is a over-simplified submission manager for literary submissions. It's primary purpose is to fulfill all the requirements for Code Louisville and facilitate learning. 

Typically, a submission manager would be added onto an existing web page and be used to collect and organize submission and user data. The back end of the project would allow members of the editorial staff to view submissions and make publication decisions. This project doesn't allow for multiple user accounts. It merely collects data and stores it in a database, collects a text document, and displays a table with most of the pertinent information.

Database credentials are set in "inc/credentials". Credentials are included.
